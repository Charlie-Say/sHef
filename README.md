Abstract: Build a web scraper for a voice activated and responsive program that will answer culinary questions of xyz items/ingredients.


Functionality:

- able to answer questions from user using voice recognition
- able to search information of ingredients by seaonality/pairings/info/region/storage/techniques/etc.
- efficiently identify products that pair well together
- seasonality can be dependent on region
- help culinary enthusiasts to be creative and knowledgable about local sources
- maybe identify local farms/suppliers? (MAYBE - would take another BS4 program to scrape. Parsing is time consuming. Make this an add on)


TO DO:

- create SDLC (technical document for project)
- begin project management in GITHUB
- create branches for push/pull requests to and from project updates
- upload README file and all module files
